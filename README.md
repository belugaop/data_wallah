The Sequence Analysis Tool is a Python-based application designed for performing various computational biology tasks, including sequence alignment, motif finding, and gene prediction. This tool provides a user-friendly interface and allows users to work with biological sequences, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins.

## Features

- Sequence input: Accepts sequences in standard formats (e.g., FASTA, GenBank) via manual input or file uploads.
- Sequence alignment: Implements sequence alignment algorithms, including pairwise and multiple sequence alignment.
- Motif finding: Provides tools for identifying conserved motifs within sequences.
- Gene prediction: Includes functionality for predicting coding regions within DNA sequences.
- Database integration: Stores and retrieves sequence data and analysis results in a MySQL database.
